Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work."	6.8	760	https://www.drugs.com/doxycycline.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/acne.html

The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin.

Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store.

Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work."	6.4	669	https://www.drugs.com/mtm/drospirenone-and-ethinyl-estradiol.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/acne.html

It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work."	3.8	187	https://www.drugs.com/mtm/ethinyl-estradiol-and-norethindrone-hrt.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/acne.html

Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store.

There are three main subgroups of ADHD: Predominantly inattentive ADHD: inattention is the main characteristic, daydreaming is common Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive ADHD: hyperactivity and impulsiveness predominate Combined ADHD: all three behaviors (inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness) are present. What are the Symptoms of ADHD? Each person varies in the severity and frequency of their symptoms. Originally it was thought that ADHD was more common in boys; however, experts believe girls are more likely to present with inattentive characteristics and are more likely overlooked. ADHD occurs across all races and socioeconomic groups. Symptoms can be grouped depending on the predominant behavior. Examples of inattentive behavior include: Being easily distracted Daydreaming Disorganization Making silly mistakes Often late Short attention span. Examples of hyperactive behavior include: Constantly moving Fidgeting High energy levels Restlessness Trouble sitting still Trouble switching off/sleeping. Examples of impulsive behavior include: Acting without thinking Blurting out answers/secrets Interrupting Prone to accidents. Other symptoms that are common to people with ADHD include: Creativity High Intelligence Delayed social maturity Enthusiasm Sensitivity. What Causes ADHD? The causes of ADHD are not fully known, but research is actively ongoing. There does appear to be a link between a family history of ADHD (genetics) with over 25% of relatives of families with a child with ADHD who also had the condition. There is also an 82% chance that identical twins will both have ADHD if at least one of them has the condition compared to a 38% chance among fraternal twins. Other factors that have been identified as possibly contributing to ADHD include: Brain injury from a traumatic event (eg, stroke, head trauma, tumor) Exposure to lead after birth Low birth weight Fetal exposure to alcohol or cigarette smoke Herbicides Pesticides. There is no evidence that poor parenting, certain foods, sugar, or vaccinations cause ADHD. How is ADHD Diagnosed? If your child has symptoms suggestive of ADHD then talk with your doctor or pediatrician. They will talk with you, your child, and possibly your child’s school and ask questions that focus on: Ability to control emotions Attentiveness Focus Home and school relationships Hyperactivity. They will ask if your family has any other family members with ADHD. Most cases of ADHD are diagnosed at age 7 or 8, but symptoms may begin sooner. ADHD usually still persists into adulthood; however, some people have learned how to manage their symptoms better so it may not be as noticeable. How is ADHD Treated? Behavioral education should be considered as first-line treatment for any case of ADHD, particularly in children aged less than 6 years of age, with mild symptoms, or if the family prefers this option over drug therapy. Pharmacological treatments for ADHD include: Atomoxetine Amphetamine and dextroamphetamine salts Methylphenidate Other treatments, such as clonidine or guanfacine."	7.4	360	https://www.drugs.com/adderall.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/attention-deficit-disorder.html

ADHD usually still persists into adulthood; however, some people have learned how to manage their symptoms better so it may not be as noticeable. How is ADHD Treated? Behavioral education should be considered as first-line treatment for any case of ADHD, particularly in children aged less than 6 years of age, with mild symptoms, or if the family prefers this option over drug therapy.

It is a virus that attacks the immune system, specifically CD4 cells (also called T cells), which eventually reduces a person’s ability to fight infection. HIV can progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) if left untreated. What Causes HIV? HIV is thought to have originally mutated from a virus that infects chimpanzees, called simian immunodeficiency virus. Research has indicated that the virus probably mutated into HIV, which is a version that could infect humans, as far back as the late 1800s when the chimpanzees were hunted for meat. HIV has been present in the United States since the mid to late 1970s. Who is at Risk for HIV? HIV can infect any person, no matter their age or gender or sexual preference. It is spread sexually, and by contact with infected blood, from mother to child during pregnancy, during childbirth, or through breast-feeding. People have a higher risk of contracting HIV if they: Have sex. Even condoms don’t provide 100% protection against HIV and the virus can enter your body through mouth sores following oral sex. Have a blood transfusion, especially in certain countries overseas. The risk in America is very small as hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies. Share needles. IV drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) may be contaminated with HIV or other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis Are pregnant and are HIV positive. Treatment for HIV during pregnancy significantly lowers the risk of passing on the infection to their babies Have a sexually transmitted infection (STI). STIs act as a gateway to HIV infection because they compromise tissues or break the skin barrier in your genital area Are an uncircumcised man. Research has shown this increases the transmission of HIV. HIV cannot be spread through hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection. It is also not spread through insect bites, air, or water. What are the Symptoms of HIV? The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. When you first acquire HIV it may take a month or two before symptoms show and these may last a week or two. Even then these may easily be confused with another type of viral illness, such as the flu, or so mild as not to be noticed initially. Symptoms of an initial acute HIV infection may include: Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Painful mouth sores Rash Sore throat Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck. The infection is easily spread during this stage. The next stage of HIV infection is called clinical latent infection . Generally, there are few signs or symptoms during this stage which may last approximately 10 years, although some people may develop persistent swelling of the lymph nodes or more severe disease sooner. HIV persists in the bloodstream and white blood cells. Infections start to become more common as the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells. Signs and symptoms of symptomatic HIV infection include: Fever Fatigue Diarrhea Weight loss Yeast infection (eg, oral thrush) Shingles Swollen lymph nodes. If left untreated, HIV usually progresses to AIDS (also known as stage 3 HIV ) in about 10 years, although some people never develop AIDS despite never having treatment. A person is said to have AIDS when their CD4 count (a protein found on the surface of immune cells) falls below 200 (or the CD4 percentage falls below 14%) or when they develop certain opportunistic infections or cancers. How is HIV Treated? Although there is no cure for HIV, medications can dramatically slow the progression of the disease and people can live a relatively infection-free life. Few people die of AIDS these days thanks to effective treatments. Medications used to treat HIV are called antiretrovirals (also referred to as ART or ARV). Most people with HIV take combination ART every day. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission. Approved ARV treatments are grouped into seven drug classes as follows: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) Protease inhibitors (PIs) Fusion inhibitors CCR5 antagonists Post-attachment inhibitors Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs)."	5.1	7	https://www.drugs.com/mtm/efavirenz.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/hiv-infection.html

Substances that cause allergies are called allergens or “triggers”. What Causes Allergies? When you have allergies, your immune system mistakes normally harmless substances for dangerous invaders and produces antibodies to fight them. These antibodies release chemicals, such as histamine, that cause allergy symptoms. The most common allergens are: Animal fur or hair (such as that from cats, dogs, horses, or rabbits) Dust mites Food, especially cow’s milk, eggs, peanuts, seafood, soy, tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews) and wheat Insect stings Latex Medicines Mould Pollen. An allergen for one person may not cause any problems in another person. There is a link between allergy and asthma. What are the Symptoms of Allergies? Reactions to the same allergen vary among individuals and depend on how the allergen entered the body (for example, being bitten by a mosquito causes a localized reaction on the skin whereas exposure to pollen may cause a tickly throat and itchy eyes). Symptoms may include: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting (food allergies) Areas of swelling and redness where a person has been stung or bitten (for insect bites/stings) Cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath Itching of the nose, eyes or roof of the mouth A skin rash or hives, usually accompanied by body-wide itching Runny, stuffy nose Sneezing Swelling of the lips, tongue, face, or throat Tingling of the mouth Watery, red or swollen eyes (conjunctivitis) Wheezing. Some types of allergies can trigger a severe reaction known as anaphylaxis. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Loss of consciousness A drop in blood pressure Severe shortness of breath Skin rash Lightheadedness A rapid, weak pulse Nausea and vomiting. When Should I See a Doctor for my Allergies? Many allergies can be effectively treated with over-the-counter medications. See your doctor if you have persistent allergies that are interfering with your day to day life if you have severe reactions, or over the counter, remedies are not effective. People who develop anaphylaxis should always carry an epinephrine auto-injector 24 hours a day and know how to use it. People should also visit the emergency department after using the auto-injector to ensure symptoms don't return when the effects of the injection wear off. How Are Allergies Treated? Treatment depends on what is the most troublesome or predominant symptom. Treatments may include: Antihistamines (oral, nasal, topical) Corticosteroids (oral, nasal, topical) Decongestants (oral, nasal) Saline nasal rinses Immunotherapy. People with known allergies should try and avoid known triggers and wear a medical alert bracelet (or necklace) that lets others know that you have a serious allergy in case you have a reaction and you're unable to communicate."	4.7	213	https://www.drugs.com/levocetirizine.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/allergies.html

Angina is a symptom of a condition called myocardial ischemia. It occurs when the heart muscle (myocardium) doesn't get as much blood (hence as much oxygen) as it needs. This usually happens because one or more of the heart's arteries (blood vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle) is narrowed or blocked. Insufficient blood supply is called ischemia. Typical angina is uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing or pain in the center of the chest. The discomfort also may be felt in the neck, jaw, shoulder, back or arm.

It may also be called nervousness. Occasional anxiety concerning a stressful or uncomfortable event is normal. However, if a person feels disproportionate levels of anxiety or it is present almost continuously, it might be diagnosed as an anxiety disorder. What Causes Anxiety? Anxiety is part of our survival response and is the way our body responds to potentially harmful or worrying triggers. Strong emotions or fear cause a surge of epinephrine (also called adrenaline) from our adrenal glands. This increases our heartbeat, increases our sensitivity to our surroundings, and prepares us for physical confrontation or to flee if we perceive any threats to our safety. This is often called the fight or flight response. Anxieties today mostly revolve around family, friends, health, money, or work. People more at risk of anxiety disorders include those: With relationship problems Whose jobs involve long hours, high workloads, little support, or danger With family members with anxiety disorders With medical conditions that result in significant lifestyle adjustments, pain, or restricted movement Who have experienced stressful or traumatic events Withdrawing from alcohol, opioids, or other substances. What are the Symptoms of an Anxiety Disorder? Symptoms of an anxiety disorder are usually out of proportion to the original trigger or stressor. If these are accompanied by significant physical symptoms such as increased sweating or increased blood pressure then a person is more likely to have an anxiety disorder rather than stimulus-appropriate anxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic, ongoing condition with excessive worry over normal life events, whether minor or major. These feelings are usually out of proportion to the trouble that you may encounter in your everyday life. With GAD, feelings come on gradually and are present each day, not in one individual attack, and last for months, even years. Worry may be so excessive that it interferes with your daily life. GAD may also be accompanied by depression and substance abuse disorders. Symptoms of GAD include: Excessive and uncontrollable worry Increased irritability Difficulty concentrating Restlessness or a feeling of being on edge Rapid breathing Excessive perspiration and sweating Trembling, quivering Fatigue Trouble concentrating Headaches, stomach upset Avoidance of circumstances that might trigger severe anxiety Sleep difficulties. Other anxiety disorders include panic disorder, phobias, selective mutism, social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder. How is Anxiety or an Anxiety Disorder Treated? Treatment depends on the severity and type of anxiety disorder and if it is interfering with everyday life. Treatments may include: Stress management Relaxation techniques Mental imagery (replacing negative thoughts with positive ones) Cognitive Behavioral therapy Counseling Support Exercise Medications."	8.5	552	https://www.drugs.com/xanax.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/anxiety.html

It may also be called nervousness. Occasional anxiety concerning a stressful or uncomfortable event is normal. However, if a person feels disproportionate levels of anxiety or it is present almost continuously, it might be diagnosed as an anxiety disorder. What Causes Anxiety? Anxiety is part of our survival response and is the way our body responds to potentially harmful or worrying triggers. Strong emotions or fear cause a surge of epinephrine (also called adrenaline) from our adrenal glands. This increases our heartbeat, increases our sensitivity to our surroundings, and prepares us for physical confrontation or to flee if we perceive any threats to our safety. This is often called the fight or flight response. Anxieties today mostly revolve around family, friends, health, money, or work. People more at risk of anxiety disorders include those: With relationship problems Whose jobs involve long hours, high workloads, little support, or danger With family members with anxiety disorders With medical conditions that result in significant lifestyle adjustments, pain, or restricted movement Who have experienced stressful or traumatic events Withdrawing from alcohol, opioids, or other substances. What are the Symptoms of an Anxiety Disorder? Symptoms of an anxiety disorder are usually out of proportion to the original trigger or stressor. If these are accompanied by significant physical symptoms such as increased sweating or increased blood pressure then a person is more likely to have an anxiety disorder rather than stimulus-appropriate anxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic, ongoing condition with excessive worry over normal life events, whether minor or major. These feelings are usually out of proportion to the trouble that you may encounter in your everyday life.

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who don’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: This aims to improve disruptions to your biological or social rhythms (such as sleep disturbances and relationship issues).

However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who don’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: This aims to improve disruptions to your biological or social rhythms (such as sleep disturbances and relationship issues). Family focused therapy: This involves your family in your treatment, educating them and allowing them to support you fully."	6.9	53	https://www.drugs.com/sertraline.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/bipolar-disorder.html

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who don’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: This aims to improve disruptions to your biological or social rhythms (such as sleep disturbances and relationship issues). Family focused therapy: This involves your family in your treatment, educating them and allowing them to support you fully."	8.2	7	https://www.drugs.com/mtm/zyprexa-zydis.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/bipolar-disorder.html

It causes inflammation in the lining of your bronchial tubes - these are the tubes that carry air from your trachea (windpipe) into your lungs. Bronchitis is most often caused by viruses, usually the same ones that cause a cold or the flu, although sometimes bacteria are to blame. Some people are more prone to getting bronchitis than others. People at higher risk include those who: Smoke Have a weak immune system Have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Work around airborne irritants such as chemical fumes or dust Live in cities or areas with high amounts of air pollution Are not vaccinated against the flu (the flu can lead to bronchitis). Symptoms of Bronchitis Symptoms of bronchitis can vary from mild to severe but usually include: A nagging productive cough that persists for several days to weeks Increased mucus production from the lungs. This is thicker than normal and may be discolored (yellowish-grey, green, rarely blood-streaked) Fatigue Chest tightness or discomfort Shortness of breath. Bronchitis is not usually accompanied by a fever. If you have a fever, you may have pneumonia or the flu instead. Bronchitis can develop into pneumonia in some people. Bronchitis may be described as acute or chronic. Acute bronchitis usually follows a cold or the flu and symptoms usually get better within a week although you may be left with a cough that lingers for several weeks. If your cough lasts for at least three months and you get recurring bouts of bronchitis over a period of two years it is referred to as chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is often due to smoking and is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Diagnosis of Bronchitis See a doctor if your cough lasts more than three weeks, is accompanied by a fever, is blood-tinged, or associated with wheezing or shortness of breath. Your doctor will perform a physical exam and listen to your lungs as you breathe with a stethoscope. A chest X-ray, sputum tests, or pulmonary function tests may also be conducted to help with the diagnosis. Treatment of Bronchitis Bronchitis is most often caused by viruses, so antibiotics will not help treat the condition. Most cases of acute bronchitis get better by themselves without treatment within a couple of weeks. Cough medications may help with sleep at night and people with other conditions (such as asthma or COPD) may benefit from bronchodilators and corticosteroids to open up their airways and reduce inflammation. People with chronic bronchitis may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation – this is where a respiratory therapist teaches you exercises to help you breathe more easily and increase your ability to partake in physical activity. Nonpharmacological treatments can also help you feel better, such as: Warm lemon and honey drinks Humidifiers – these produce warm moist air which loosens mucus in the airway allowing you to cough it up easier Wearing a mask or a buff over your mouth outside if you are exposed to cold air, smoke, fumes, or other pollutants."	7.5	4	https://www.drugs.com/erythromycin.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/bronchitis.html

Sometimes it can affect your outlook on life and make you feel that life isn’t worth living. Depression may also be called major depressive disorder or clinical depression. What Causes Depression? Experts aren’t exactly sure what causes depression but believe it is due to a combination of different factors, such as genetic vulnerability, faulty mood regulation by the brain, stress, chemicals in the brain, medications, or medical problems, that all interact together to bring on depression. The risk of developing depression is higher in women and people: Aged 45 to 64 years of age or the elderly With chronic or acute health conditions Who are undergoing a major life event, such as a job loss, divorce, workplace stress, or physical or mental abuse With severe grief due to the death of a loved one Taking prescription drugs that may cause a low mood Abusing alcohol or drugs. What are the Symptoms of Depression? Depression is not just feeling blue occasionally. It affects daily feelings, thoughts, and actions over a longer period. (MDD), can result in difficulties with family life, work, and social activities. Symptoms may vary depending on how severe a person’s depression is but may include: A prolonged and persistent low mood, tearfulness, or a sense of hopelessness that has lasted for at least 2 weeks Irritability Anxiety Agitation or restlessness Avoidance or refusal to participate in activities that were previously enjoyed Withdrawal socially, from family, friends, and relationships Changes in sleeping or eating habits Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches Alcohol, drug, or substance abuse Engaging in risky or destructive behaviors Self-harm or attempts at suicide. In children and teens, symptoms may include clinginess, worry, aches and pain, and refusal to go to school. In older adults, symptoms may be less obvious and include memory difficulties or personality changes, physical aches and pains, and fatigue. How is Depression Diagnosed?

Although some symptoms may be similar, it is a different condition to type 1 diabetes. Unlike people with type 1 diabetes, most people with type 2 diabetes still produce insulin. However, it is either not enough to deal with all the glucose that is in their blood or their cells are unable to recognize the insulin and use it properly (this is called insulin resistance). Type 2 diabetes usually affects people who are middle-aged or older, and obesity is by far the biggest risk factor. In the past two decades, the condition has become more prevalent in younger people, including children, mainly because of the rising rates of obesity in children. People who do little exercise or of certain ethnicities (such as Native Americans, African-Americans, and Hispanics) are also at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. What are the Symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes? Symptoms of type 2 Diabetes usually come on gradually and may be so subtle that many people do not realize they have the condition. Symptoms may include: Always feeling thirsty Feeling hungry, even though you eat regularly Going to the toilet (urinating) often Getting sick frequently, or frequent skin infections, particularly yeast or fungal infections Infections take longer to heal Feeling tired all the time or lacking in energy Blurred or deteriorating vision. How is Type 2 Diabetes Diagnosed? Some doctors screen for diabetes in people of a certain age and it is usually always screened for in pregnant women. If you or your doctor suspects you have type 2 diabetes then they may perform a blood test on the spot that tests for blood sugar levels using a fingerprick or order a blood test that tests for blood sugar levels in the morning after an overnight fast. Your doctor will also perform an examination and measure your blood pressure. Tests for cholesterol may also be conducted because approximately one-third of people with type 2 diabetes also have high blood pressure and high cholesterol as well. How is Type 2 Diabetes Treated? Even though symptoms of type 2 diabetes are barely noticeable in some people, constantly high blood sugar levels cause permanent damage to all the blood vessels and nerves in the body. Untreated diabetes can lead to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, erectile dysfunction, foot problems, gum disease, eye and kidney disease, and many other problems. If treatment is not started early, it is too late to reverse any damage once symptoms become more noticeable. Treatments for Type 2 diabetes include: Metformin Sulfonylureas Meglitinides Thiazolidinediones DPP-4 inhibitors GLP-1 receptor agonists SGLT2 inhibitors Insulin."	5.9	253	https://www.drugs.com/metformin.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/diabetes-mellitus-type-ii.html

People who do little exercise or of certain ethnicities (such as Native Americans, African-Americans, and Hispanics) are also at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. What are the Symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes? Symptoms of type 2 Diabetes usually come on gradually and may be so subtle that many people do not realize they have the condition. Symptoms may include: Always feeling thirsty Feeling hungry, even though you eat regularly Going to the toilet (urinating) often Getting sick frequently, or frequent skin infections, particularly yeast or fungal infections Infections take longer to heal Feeling tired all the time or lacking in energy Blurred or deteriorating vision. How is Type 2 Diabetes Diagnosed? Some doctors screen for diabetes in people of a certain age and it is usually always screened for in pregnant women. If you or your doctor suspects you have type 2 diabetes then they may perform a blood test on the spot that tests for blood sugar levels using a fingerprick or order a blood test that tests for blood sugar levels in the morning after an overnight fast. Your doctor will also perform an examination and measure your blood pressure. Tests for cholesterol may also be conducted because approximately one-third of people with type 2 diabetes also have high blood pressure and high cholesterol as well. How is Type 2 Diabetes Treated? Even though symptoms of type 2 diabetes are barely noticeable in some people, constantly high blood sugar levels cause permanent damage to all the blood vessels and nerves in the body. Untreated diabetes can lead to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, erectile dysfunction, foot problems, gum disease, eye and kidney disease, and many other problems. If treatment is not started early, it is too late to reverse any damage once symptoms become more noticeable. Treatments for Type 2 diabetes include: Metformin Sulfonylureas Meglitinides Thiazolidinediones DPP-4 inhibitors GLP-1 receptor agonists SGLT2 inhibitors Insulin."	7.6	516	https://www.drugs.com/mtm/liraglutide.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/diabetes-mellitus-type-ii.html

High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Measuring somebody's blood pressure gives us an indication of how effectively their heart is working to pump blood around their body. If their heart and blood vessels are working efficiently, then their blood pressure will be normal or slightly below normal. If their heart is having to work very hard to pump blood around their body, then their blood pressure will be high. Blood pressure is composed of two measurements. The first recording is called the systolic pressure and it measures the force the heart must pump against to get blood to flow around the body. It can indicate how flexible or stiff the blood vessels are. During this measurement, the blood pressure cuff inflates to a certain extent and records what pressure around the arm stops blood flow. The second recording is called diastolic pressure. This measures the resting pressure when the heart relaxes between heartbeats. It is recorded while the blood pressure cuff is deflating. Most experts consider a normal blood pressure to be 120/80 mm Hg. Ideally, everybody’s blood pressure should be below 130/80 mm Hg. If the first number is above 130 or the second number is above 80 then a person is said to have high blood pressure. What are the symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people experience no symptoms when their blood pressure is high. Sometimes people may develop a headache or feel unwell; however, most do not connect these vague symptoms as having to do with their heart. If high blood pressure is left untreated, it can damage the blood vessels and increase a person’s risk of having a stroke or a heart attack. It also causes the heart to enlarge and weaken because it essentially wears itself out from having to work so hard to push blood around the body. People with high blood pressure are also more likely to develop high cholesterol, kidney and eye problems, and have poor circulation in the legs and feet. How is High Blood Pressure Diagnosed? It is not uncommon for your blood pressure to go high occasionally; however, it is persistently high blood pressure that is a concern. For this reason, if a doctor or nurse takes your blood pressure and it is high but you don’t have any risk factors or symptoms, then at least two other separate measurements should be taken before you are diagnosed with high blood pressure. Before getting your blood pressure taken you should avoid the following for at least an hour before the measurement: Strenuous exercise Smoking Caffeine Eating Stressful situations. Sit down for at least five minutes before the reading is taken and don’t talk while it is being measured. Other tests may be ordered if your doctor concludes you have high blood pressure. These may include blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and sometimes a chest x-ray. How is High Blood Pressure Treated? Treatment depends on how high your blood pressure is. For people whose systolic reading falls in the range 120 to 129 and the diastolic reading is equal to or less than 80, lifestyle changes are usually recommended over medications. These may include: Losing weight if you are overweight Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables Eating less salt Eating less saturated fats Increased physical activity More physical activity Limiting alcohol. If treatment is considered necessary, sometimes more than one medication is prescribed. high blood pressure include: Diuretics Beta-blockers ACE inhibitors Angiotensin-receptor blockers Calcium channel blockers Alpha-blockers."	5.6	75	https://www.drugs.com/mtm/hydrochlorothiazide-and-lisinopril.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/hypertension.html

If their heart is having to work very hard to pump blood around their body, then their blood pressure will be high. Blood pressure is composed of two measurements. The first recording is called the systolic pressure and it measures the force the heart must pump against to get blood to flow around the body. It can indicate how flexible or stiff the blood vessels are. During this measurement, the blood pressure cuff inflates to a certain extent and records what pressure around the arm stops blood flow. The second recording is called diastolic pressure. This measures the resting pressure when the heart relaxes between heartbeats. It is recorded while the blood pressure cuff is deflating. Most experts consider a normal blood pressure to be 120/80 mm Hg. Ideally, everybody’s blood pressure should be below 130/80 mm Hg. If the first number is above 130 or the second number is above 80 then a person is said to have high blood pressure. What are the symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people experience no symptoms when their blood pressure is high. Sometimes people may develop a headache or feel unwell; however, most do not connect these vague symptoms as having to do with their heart. If high blood pressure is left untreated, it can damage the blood vessels and increase a person’s risk of having a stroke or a heart attack. It also causes the heart to enlarge and weaken because it essentially wears itself out from having to work so hard to push blood around the body. People with high blood pressure are also more likely to develop high cholesterol, kidney and eye problems, and have poor circulation in the legs and feet. How is High Blood Pressure Diagnosed? It is not uncommon for your blood pressure to go high occasionally; however, it is persistently high blood pressure that is a concern. For this reason, if a doctor or nurse takes your blood pressure and it is high but you don’t have any risk factors or symptoms, then at least two other separate measurements should be taken before you are diagnosed with high blood pressure. Before getting your blood pressure taken you should avoid the following for at least an hour before the measurement: Strenuous exercise Smoking Caffeine Eating Stressful situations. Sit down for at least five minutes before the reading is taken and don’t talk while it is being measured. Other tests may be ordered if your doctor concludes you have high blood pressure. These may include blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and sometimes a chest x-ray. How is High Blood Pressure Treated? Treatment depends on how high your blood pressure is. For people whose systolic reading falls in the range 120 to 129 and the diastolic reading is equal to or less than 80, lifestyle changes are usually recommended over medications. These may include: Losing weight if you are overweight Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables Eating less salt Eating less saturated fats Increased physical activity More physical activity Limiting alcohol.

High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Measuring somebody's blood pressure gives us an indication of how effectively their heart is working to pump blood around their body. If their heart and blood vessels are working efficiently, then their blood pressure will be normal or slightly below normal. If their heart is having to work very hard to pump blood around their body, then their blood pressure will be high. Blood pressure is composed of two measurements. The first recording is called the systolic pressure and it measures the force the heart must pump against to get blood to flow around the body. It can indicate how flexible or stiff the blood vessels are. During this measurement, the blood pressure cuff inflates to a certain extent and records what pressure around the arm stops blood flow. The second recording is called diastolic pressure. This measures the resting pressure when the heart relaxes between heartbeats. It is recorded while the blood pressure cuff is deflating. Most experts consider a normal blood pressure to be 120/80 mm Hg. Ideally, everybody’s blood pressure should be below 130/80 mm Hg. If the first number is above 130 or the second number is above 80 then a person is said to have high blood pressure. What are the symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people experience no symptoms when their blood pressure is high. Sometimes people may develop a headache or feel unwell; however, most do not connect these vague symptoms as having to do with their heart. If high blood pressure is left untreated, it can damage the blood vessels and increase a person’s risk of having a stroke or a heart attack. It also causes the heart to enlarge and weaken because it essentially wears itself out from having to work so hard to push blood around the body. People with high blood pressure are also more likely to develop high cholesterol, kidney and eye problems, and have poor circulation in the legs and feet. How is High Blood Pressure Diagnosed? It is not uncommon for your blood pressure to go high occasionally; however, it is persistently high blood pressure that is a concern. For this reason, if a doctor or nurse takes your blood pressure and it is high but you don’t have any risk factors or symptoms, then at least two other separate measurements should be taken before you are diagnosed with high blood pressure. Before getting your blood pressure taken you should avoid the following for at least an hour before the measurement: Strenuous exercise Smoking Caffeine Eating Stressful situations. Sit down for at least five minutes before the reading is taken and don’t talk while it is being measured. Other tests may be ordered if your doctor concludes you have high blood pressure. These may include blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and sometimes a chest x-ray. How is High Blood Pressure Treated? Treatment depends on how high your blood pressure is. For people whose systolic reading falls in the range 120 to 129 and the diastolic reading is equal to or less than 80, lifestyle changes are usually recommended over medications. These may include: Losing weight if you are overweight Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables Eating less salt Eating less saturated fats Increased physical activity More physical activity Limiting alcohol.

High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Measuring somebody's blood pressure gives us an indication of how effectively their heart is working to pump blood around their body. If their heart and blood vessels are working efficiently, then their blood pressure will be normal or slightly below normal. If their heart is having to work very hard to pump blood around their body, then their blood pressure will be high. Blood pressure is composed of two measurements. The first recording is called the systolic pressure and it measures the force the heart must pump against to get blood to flow around the body. It can indicate how flexible or stiff the blood vessels are. During this measurement, the blood pressure cuff inflates to a certain extent and records what pressure around the arm stops blood flow. The second recording is called diastolic pressure. This measures the resting pressure when the heart relaxes between heartbeats. It is recorded while the blood pressure cuff is deflating. Most experts consider a normal blood pressure to be 120/80 mm Hg. Ideally, everybody’s blood pressure should be below 130/80 mm Hg. If the first number is above 130 or the second number is above 80 then a person is said to have high blood pressure. What are the symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people experience no symptoms when their blood pressure is high. Sometimes people may develop a headache or feel unwell; however, most do not connect these vague symptoms as having to do with their heart. If high blood pressure is left untreated, it can damage the blood vessels and increase a person’s risk of having a stroke or a heart attack. It also causes the heart to enlarge and weaken because it essentially wears itself out from having to work so hard to push blood around the body. People with high blood pressure are also more likely to develop high cholesterol, kidney and eye problems, and have poor circulation in the legs and feet. How is High Blood Pressure Diagnosed? It is not uncommon for your blood pressure to go high occasionally; however, it is persistently high blood pressure that is a concern. For this reason, if a doctor or nurse takes your blood pressure and it is high but you don’t have any risk factors or symptoms, then at least two other separate measurements should be taken before you are diagnosed with high blood pressure. Before getting your blood pressure taken you should avoid the following for at least an hour before the measurement: Strenuous exercise Smoking Caffeine Eating Stressful situations. Sit down for at least five minutes before the reading is taken and don’t talk while it is being measured. Other tests may be ordered if your doctor concludes you have high blood pressure. These may include blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and sometimes a chest x-ray. How is High Blood Pressure Treated? Treatment depends on how high your blood pressure is. For people whose systolic reading falls in the range 120 to 129 and the diastolic reading is equal to or less than 80, lifestyle changes are usually recommended over medications. These may include: Losing weight if you are overweight Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables Eating less salt Eating less saturated fats Increased physical activity More physical activity Limiting alcohol.

It is mostly due to the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. Cartilage is a firm, rubbery material that covers the end of each bone. It provides a smooth gliding surface for joint motion and acts as a cushion between bones. Without cartilage, friction between bones can occur and there is a loss of the shock-absorbing capability of the joint. Inflammatory processes increase which further damages the cartilage and more pressure is placed directly onto the bones in a joint. Pressure can cause the growth of bone spurs and bits of bone or cartilage may chip off and float around the joint. Obesity, injuries, and weak muscles can also contribute to osteoarthritis and it is more common in certain families. Osteoarthritis most commonly occurs in the hands, knees, hips and spine. What are the Symptoms of Osteoarthritis? Symptoms vary depending on how many joints are affected and how severely they are affected. Symptoms also tend to build up gradually over time rather than come on suddenly and include: Pain and stiffness in the affected joints, particularly first thing in the morning or after inactivity. This tends to resolve within about 30 minutes of gentle movement Limited range of movement in a joint Affected joints may swell after extended activity Clicking or a cracking sound when a joint bends Pain may also increase after activity or towards the end of the day. Symptoms can differ depending on which joint is affected. Knee joints: moving the knee causes a grating or scraping sensation Hip joints: Pain may radiate down the inside of the knee or thigh or be felt in the groin or buttock area Fingers: Bony growths (spurs) may occur inside the joint causing the joints to become swollen, tender and red Inflammatory arthritis of the hand: All day stiffness may be noticed early in the disease Feet: Swelling and pain may be felt at the base of the big toe or around the ankles. How is Osteoarthritis Diagnosed? Your doctor will perform a physical examination and ask you about your history of symptoms and whether you have any family members with the condition. Other tests may include: Blood tests to look for inflammatory markers Joint aspiration to look for evidence of joint deterioration or crystals X-ray of the joint to look for bone changes MRI to provide a better image of cartilage changes. Morning stiffness helps to differentiate osteoarthritis from rheumatoid arthritis. With rheumatoid arthritis, joint stiffness may not improve for several hours or it may last throughout the entire day. How is Osteoarthritis Treated? Treatment for osteoarthritis includes lifestyle changes and medications. All patients with osteoarthritis should be enrolled in an exercise program because physical activity increases blood flow, and joints and muscles are supplied with more oxygen. Swimming, Tai Chi and weight-based exercises are usually suitable for people with osteoarthritis, although a physician should be consulted before starting any exercise program. Weight loss can lower the risk of pain in weight-bearing joints and orthotics, devices that help to align joints - orthotic shoe inserts, splints, and braces can help with movement. Heat or cold therapy can also relieve joint swelling. osteoarthritis may include: Acetaminophen NSAIDs Topical capsaicin Duloxetine Cortisone injections Lubricating injections.

It is mostly due to the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. Cartilage is a firm, rubbery material that covers the end of each bone. It provides a smooth gliding surface for joint motion and acts as a cushion between bones. Without cartilage, friction between bones can occur and there is a loss of the shock-absorbing capability of the joint. Inflammatory processes increase which further damages the cartilage and more pressure is placed directly onto the bones in a joint. Pressure can cause the growth of bone spurs and bits of bone or cartilage may chip off and float around the joint. Obesity, injuries, and weak muscles can also contribute to osteoarthritis and it is more common in certain families. Osteoarthritis most commonly occurs in the hands, knees, hips and spine. What are the Symptoms of Osteoarthritis? Symptoms vary depending on how many joints are affected and how severely they are affected. Symptoms also tend to build up gradually over time rather than come on suddenly and include: Pain and stiffness in the affected joints, particularly first thing in the morning or after inactivity. This tends to resolve within about 30 minutes of gentle movement Limited range of movement in a joint Affected joints may swell after extended activity Clicking or a cracking sound when a joint bends Pain may also increase after activity or towards the end of the day. Symptoms can differ depending on which joint is affected. Knee joints: moving the knee causes a grating or scraping sensation Hip joints: Pain may radiate down the inside of the knee or thigh or be felt in the groin or buttock area Fingers: Bony growths (spurs) may occur inside the joint causing the joints to become swollen, tender and red Inflammatory arthritis of the hand: All day stiffness may be noticed early in the disease Feet: Swelling and pain may be felt at the base of the big toe or around the ankles. How is Osteoarthritis Diagnosed? Your doctor will perform a physical examination and ask you about your history of symptoms and whether you have any family members with the condition. Other tests may include: Blood tests to look for inflammatory markers Joint aspiration to look for evidence of joint deterioration or crystals X-ray of the joint to look for bone changes MRI to provide a better image of cartilage changes. Morning stiffness helps to differentiate osteoarthritis from rheumatoid arthritis. With rheumatoid arthritis, joint stiffness may not improve for several hours or it may last throughout the entire day. How is Osteoarthritis Treated? Treatment for osteoarthritis includes lifestyle changes and medications.

Most UTIs are caused by bacteria, such as Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , or Staphylococcus saprophyticus . Your urinary tract includes your bladder, kidneys, ureter (the tube that connects your kidneys to your bladder), and urethra (the tube that removes urine from your body). A bladder infection is a type of urinary tract infection, but not all UTIs are bladder infections. Risk Factors for UTIs Women of all ages are most at risk of UTIs because the female urethra is much shorter than the male urethra, which allows bacteria near the vagina to enter the bladder more easily. Older males are also at a higher risk. Other factors that increase the risk of a UTI include: Sexual intercourse Certain contraceptives (eg, diaphragms or spermicides) Wiping from back to front after a bowel movement The presence of kidney or bladder stones Urinating without fully emptying the bladder Pregnancy Having a urinary catheter. UTIs in children are reasonably common, affecting up to 8% of girls and 2% of boys. Young children also have a higher risk of kidney damage from UTIs than adults. Some children are born with vesicoureteral reflux, where urine reenters the bladder from one or both ureters, which also increases the likelihood of UTIs. A bladder infection is a type of urinary tract infection, but not all UTIs are bladder infections. Bladder infections are the most common type of UTIs. A bladder infection may also be called cystitis and it is usually caused by bacteria. What are the Symptoms of a UTI Symptoms of a UTI can differ depending on what part of the urinary tract is infected. A bladder infection usually causes symptoms that include the following: Burning when urinating (the medical term for this is dysuria) The feeling that you need to pee frequently, but when you go to the toilet very little urine comes out Pain in the pelvic area just above the pubic bone. Bladder infections are usually considered a “simple UTI” and treatment is usually with antibiotics (such as trimethoprim or amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium) for three to five days. Symptoms usually resolve in a couple of days. People with an infection of the urethra (called urethritis) may experience symptoms similar to a bladder infection in addition to itching or irritation at the end of the urethra where the pee comes out. Symptoms of a kidney infection are usually more widespread and more severe than those of a bladder infection and may include: Fever or chills Cloudy or foul-smelling urine Pink or red-tinged urine (this is a sign of bleeding in the urinary tract) Burning when urinating The feeling that you need to pee frequently, but when you go to the toilet very little urine comes out Pain in the pelvic area just above the pubic bone Moderate to severe lower back pain Nausea or vomiting. Kidney infections are considered the worse type of UTI and usually start as a bladder or urethra infection but then the bacteria multiply and travel up to the kidneys. Kidney infections are usually called complicated UTIs and some people may require hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics. Less severe infections may be treated with oral antibiotics over a week or more. Untreated kidney infections can be life-threatening. Preventing UTIs There is controversy over whether unsweetened cranberry juice is an effective treatment or prevention for UTIs. A 2013 review of 24 studies concluded that is was less effective than previously thought. The risk of UTIs may be lessened by staying hydrated and urinating when the need arises, not holding it in. Women should wipe from front to back after a bowel movement, urinate before and after sex, and avoiding using douches, vaginal sprays, and scented feminine hygiene products. They should avoid wearing restrictive, synthetic clothing, or change out of such clothing as soon as possible after exercising or swimming."	6.3	35	https://www.drugs.com/mtm/uribel.html	https://www.drugs.com/condition/urinary-tract-infection.html
